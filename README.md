# MarchMadnessCalculations
This was a project completed in my Data Science class during my senior year in undergrad. The project uses data from 2023 March Madness via Kaggle.com. 

The objective of the project was to use a teams existing statistics to create two new stats, Offensive Power Index (OPI) and Defensive Power Index (DPI). These stats in combination with win% would allow an anaylst to determine the likelihood of a team to win against an opponent. The idea being that the analyst has a "Say-all-be-all" statistic that removes the need to independently analyze other statistics. 


Project requires further testing with the Gaussian Naive Bayes Model.
